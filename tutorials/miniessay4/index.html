    <h1>The Internet's Future</h1>

    <section class="essay">
    <p>Compared to when it first started as ARPANET back in 1969, it took a lot to get to the internet as it is known today. It has served several purposes throughout its existence, from research conducted on communication between different computers around the country during the ARPANET days, to the development of an open internet, dubbed the World Wide Web (WWW), for the public’s usage during the 1990s. Even now, the internet that we have today is far different from the internet I experienced as a child during the early 2010s. Today’s internet feels, in a way, heavily structured and managed by a handful of corporations (Meta and X as an example), and the internet is being shaped by advertisements, trends, and corporate minimalism. As a child, the internet web felt more organic, growing at its own pace as people still personalized their social profiles through coding, and producing genuine video content to share to the world. Although the internet feels more contained today, the development of technology such as AI and experimental technology gives an interesting look into the potential stages that the internet can evolve into within the next fifty to one hundred years.

    <p>2022 marked the year that Artificial Intelligence (AI) entered the world stage with the release of ChatGPT to the public. The program’s core function of generating any text or image was an immediately captivating draw for internet users, leading to a massive blowup in ChatGPT’s popularity and the rapid development of countless other AI programs. Currently, it is hard to turn anywhere on the internet or in the tech world without seeing some sort of implementation of AI, such as Microsoft’s Copilot and the ever-encroaching use of AI in job sections such as the creative field. Alongside AI, today’s companies heavily push advertisements all over social media; scrolling to see fifteen posts on a typical feed usually shows you about one ad for every 2-3 posts. Due to the extreme boost in Tik Tok’s popularity during the pandemic times of 2020-2023, social media companies have followed suit in tailoring their own websites to be similar to the short-form video app, such as Instagram and YouTube developing their own Reels. While there are still solid communities around the web based in forums, a good portion of discussion for subjects like video games, hobbies, and even personal friend groups have been moved to social media like Discord, based in invite-open servers.

   <p>With these different aspects that form the current internet, there are currently two ways I can see it going: The optimistic version and the dystopian version. The dystopian version is much easier to get into as it feels like it is the current way the internet is going.
