    <h1>The Internet's Future</h1>

<div class="content">
    <section class="essay">
    <p>Compared to when it first started as ARPANET back in 1969, it took a lot to get to the internet as it is known today. It has served several purposes throughout its existence, from research conducted on communication between different computers around the country during the ARPANET days, to the development of an open internet, dubbed the World Wide Web (WWW), for the public’s usage during the 1990s. Even now, the internet that we have today is far different from the internet I experienced as a child during the early 2010s. Today’s internet feels, in a way, heavily structured and managed by a handful of corporations (Meta and X as an example), and the internet is being shaped by advertisements, trends, and corporate minimalism. As a child, the internet web felt more organic, growing at its own pace as people still personalized their social profiles through coding, and producing genuine video content to share to the world. Although the internet feels more contained today, the development of technology such as AI and experimental technology gives an interesting look into the potential stages that the internet can evolve into within the next fifty to one hundred years.

    <p>2022 marked the year that Artificial Intelligence (AI) entered the world stage with the release of ChatGPT to the public. The program’s core function of generating any text or image was an immediately captivating draw for internet users, leading to a massive blowup in ChatGPT’s popularity and the rapid development of countless other AI programs. Currently, it is hard to turn anywhere on the internet or in the tech world without seeing some sort of implementation of AI, such as Microsoft’s Copilot and the ever-encroaching use of AI in job sections such as the creative field. Alongside AI, today’s companies heavily push advertisements all over social media; scrolling to see fifteen posts on a typical feed usually shows you about one ad for every 2-3 posts. Due to the extreme boost in Tik Tok’s popularity during the pandemic times of 2020-2023, social media companies have followed suit in tailoring their own websites to be similar to the short-form video app, such as Instagram and YouTube developing their own Reels. While there are still solid communities around the web based in forums, a good portion of discussion for subjects like video games, hobbies, and even personal friend groups have been moved to social media like Discord, based in invite-open servers.

   <p>With these different aspects that form the current internet, there are currently two ways I can see it going: The optimistic version and the dystopian version. The dystopian version is much easier to get into as it feels like it is the current way the internet is going.  
</p>

<p>
    I imagine the future internet as a Cyberpunk-esque landscape that leans heavily into the dystopian aspect. The two biggest issues I see with the current internet, enshittification and an increasingly anti-human experience, will likely continue by then if there are no actions taken to combat them. Corporations will leave even heavier into their pervasive advertisements through different parts of the internet. Today, advertisements have been pushed into formerly ad-free subscriptions on streaming platforms as prices are jacked up. If given the chance, I believe they would insert ads into all forms of subscriptions as long as they earn the greatest amount of money possible, which is why I can see it happening in a wrecked version of the internet. On platforms such as X/Twitter and Tik Tok, an alarming amount of bots are present on the apps, contributing to exacerbating discourse and baiting human users for engagement. If this issue isn’t curbed, there can only be an increase in non-human accounts furthering encroaching on human user spaces. Due to increased funding and advancements for AI generation in both LLM and video generation, there is better technology for these bot accounts to be able to blend in as “real” users. If taken to the extreme, it would be horrifyingly difficult in the future to tell apart an AI-generated account from a real human-run account, and it could be taken a step further if these bots are run by a person or organization who have potentially malicious intentions.

<p>	If the internet were to improve, there would have to be a dedicated effort from those who care to advocate for the changes that can improve the quality of the internet itself, and the user experience as well. When it comes to fifty years down the line, the best possible case is an internet where you can have genuine interactions with other human users and no worries of maliciously-coded bots. While the minimalist aesthetic can make visuals easier to understand, the internet doesn’t have to be all different shades of gray as inspired by major companies and their branding. If the internet would be ruled as a right for all people, especially with how intertwined its functions are with our lives through social connection, career development, and available resources, there can be more funding to make sure that people have adequate devices and proper connections. With everything that the internet can provide for us, the least we can do is manage it in a way that betters the everyday population instead of making good for only corporations and the government in regards to gathering data.</p>
