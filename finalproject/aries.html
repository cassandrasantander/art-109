        <p class="body-text">Hi internet!! I am so so happy that it is finally autumn!! I'm not sure where anyone who reads my blog is from, but in my town, the trees are turning such pretty shades of orange and red! The leaves have started falling and covering the entire sidewalk while walking to campus. I have been on the look out for the most colorful ones, although I have been leaving them be, rather than picking them up.</p>
        <p class="body-text">A few years ago, my friend and I would find as much pretty leaves as possible. Once we were satisfied with our collection, we would bring them to her house. With some wax paper and a clothing iron, we would place the leaves in between two sheets and heat the paper with the iron, making a sheet of now wax-preserved leaves. I usually left the finished item alone, but my friend would like to take them out and hold the now-preserved leaves. </p>
        <p class="body-text"> I'll keep looking for some leaves.</p>
