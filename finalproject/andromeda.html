        <p class="body-text">The constellation represents a Greek princess named Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia. She is put in peril by her mother after Cassiopeia claims to be more beautiful than the Nereids. Andromeda is forced to be a sacrifice to the monster, Cetus, in exchange for the safety of her parents' kingdom.</p>
        <p class="body-text">One of the most notable objects within the constellation is the Andromeda Galaxy, an object that can be seen by the naked eye on clear dark nights. It is predicted that the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way will eventually collide in some billions of years.</p>
