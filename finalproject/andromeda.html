        <p class="body-text">A few years ago, my friend and I would find as much pretty leaves as possible. Once we were satisfied with our collection, we would bring them to her house. With some wax paper and a clothing iron, we would place the leaves in between two sheets and heat the paper with the iron, making a sheet of now wax-preserved leaves. I usually left the finished item alone, but my friend would like to take them out and hold the now-preserved leaves. </p>
        <p class="body-text"> I'll keep looking for some leaves.</p>
