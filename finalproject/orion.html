        <p class="body-text">The constellation is based on the Greek mythology's figure, who is well known to be a hunter. It is often paired with the Scorpio constellation, as one of the most popular versions of his death is where he lost to one.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The brightest star in the sky, Sirius, is also typically associated with Orion as his dog. Personally, I think it is one of the easiest constellations to spot in the sky; all you have to do is look for the three stars that make up his belt and the rest of the constellation falls into place. Another fun tidbit is that Orion is also home to the star, Betelgeuse. </p>
